# VRChat-Periodic-Pictures
A small script that can tell VRChat through OSC to take a picture every X seconds.

## Why would you want that?
Idk, more natural pictures of the moment i guess?

You could place the camera in a good spot while you're playing a game with your friends, and then let it take a picture every few minutes.
The pictures and movements would be very natural :)

Or if you're recording something cinematic, this might take some cool snapshots usable as wallpapers, without any video encoding and with VRChat Metadata :D
